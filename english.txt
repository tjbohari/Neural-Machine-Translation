Check your Internet connection.
Check if you are using third party repositories. If so disable them, since they are a common source of problems. Furthermore run the following command in a Terminal: apt-get install -f
The selected file may not be a GPG key file or it might be corrupt.
The selected key couldn't be removed. Check that you provided a valid fingerprint.
Check if you are currently running another software management tool, e.g. Synaptic or aptitude. Only one tool is allowed to make changes at a time.
This is a serious problem. Try again later. If this problem appears again, please report an error to the developers.
Check the spelling of the package name, and that the appropriate repository is enabled.
There isn't any need for an update.

There isn't any need for a removal.
You requested to remove a package which is an essential part of your system.
The connection to the daemon was lost. Most likely the background daemon crashed.
The installation or removal of a software package failed.
The requested feature is not supported.
There seems to be a programming error in aptdaemon, the software that allows you to install/remove software and to perform other package management related tasks.
This error could be caused by required additional software packages which are missing or not installable. Furthermore there could be a conflict between software packages which are not allowed to be installed at the same time.
This requires installing packages from unauthenticated sources.
The installation could have failed because of an error in the corresponding software package or it was cancelled in an unfriendly way. You have to repair this before you can install or remove any further software.
Please copy the file to your local computer and check the file permissions.
The installation of a package which violates the quality standards isn't allowed. This could cause serious problems on your computer. Please contact the person or organisation who provided this package file and include the details beneath.
The downloaded license key which is required to run this piece of software is not valid or could not be installed correctly. See the details for more information.
All available upgrades have already been installed.
The license key which allows you to use this piece of software could not be downloaded. Please check your network connection.
You don't have the required privileges to perform this action.
You either provided a wrong password or cancelled the authorization. Furthermore there could also be a technical reason for this error if you haven't seen a password dialog: your desktop environment doesn't provide a PolicyKit session agent.

Record your encryption passphrase
To encrypt your home directory or "Private" folder, a strong passphrase has been automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked with your user password, but if you ever need to manually recover this directory, you will need this passphrase. Please print or write it down and store it in a safe location. If you click "Run this action now", enter your login password at the "Passphrase" prompt and you can display your randomly generated passphrase. Otherwise, you will need to run "ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase" from the command line to retrieve and record your generated passphrase.

Resume normal boot
You are now going to exit the recovery mode and continue the boot sequence. Please note that some graphic drivers require a full graphical boot and so will fail when resuming from recovery. If that's the case, simply reboot from the login screen and then perform a standard boot.
Continuing will remount your / filesystem in read/write mode and mount any other filesystem defined in /etc/fstab. Do you wish to continue?
The option you selected requires your filesystem to be in read-only mode. Unfortunately another option you selected earlier, made you exit this mode. The easiest way of getting back in read-only mode is to reboot your system.
GKsu version %s
Usage: %s [-u <user>] [options] <command>
--debug, -d Print information on the screen that might be useful for diagnosing and/or solving problems.
--user <user>, -u <user> Call <command> as the specified user.
--disable-grab, -g Disable the "locking" of the keyboard, mouse, and focus done by the program when asking for password.
--prompt, -P Ask the user if they want to have their keyboard and mouse grabbed before doing so.
--preserve-env, -k Preserve the current environments, does not set $HOME nor $PATH, for example.
--login, -l Make this a login shell. Beware this may cause problems with the Xauthority magic. Run xhost to allow the target user to open windows on your display!
--description <description\_BAR_file>, -D <description\_BAR_file> Provide a descriptive name for the command to be used in the default message, making it nicer. You can also provide the absolute path for a .desktop file. The Name key for will be used in this case.
--message <message>, -m <message> Replace the standard message shown to ask for password for the argument passed to the option. Only use this if --description does not suffice.
--print-pass, -p Ask gksu to print the password to stdout, just like ssh-askpass. Useful to use in scripts with programs that accept receiving the password on stdin.
--sudo-mode, -S Make GKSu use sudo instead of su, as if it had been run as "gksudo".
--su-mode, -w Make GKSu use su, instead of using libgksu's default.
--always-ask-pass Make GKSu always ask for a password, even if it is cached by sudo.

External program normalize is not installed.K3b uses normalize (http://normalize.nongnu.org/) to normalize audio tracks. In order to use this functionality, please install it first.
%1 will be run with root privileges on kernel >= 2.6.8
Since Linux kernel 2.6.8 %1 will not work when run suid root for security reasons anymore.
%1 will be run without root privileges
It is highly recommended to configure cdrecord to run with root privileges, as then cdrecord runs with high priority that increases the overall stability of the burning process. As well as this, it allows the size of the burning buffer to be changed, and a lot of user problems can be solved this way.
It is highly recommended to configure cdrdao to run with root privileges to increase the overall stability of the burning process.
MP3 Audio Decoder plugin not found.
K3b could not load or find the MP3 decoder plugin. This means that you will not be able to create Audio CDs from MP3 files. Many Linux distributions do not include MP3 support for legal reasons.
To enable MP3 support, please install the MAD MP3 decoding library as well as the K3b MAD MP3 decoder plugin (the latter may already be installed but not functional due to the missing libmad). Some distributions allow installation of MP3 support via an online update tool.
System locale charset is ANSI_X3.4-1968
Your system's locale charset (i.e. the charset used to encode filenames) is set to ANSI_X3.4-1968. It is highly unlikely that this has been done intentionally. Most likely the locale is not set at all. An invalid setting will result in problems when creating data projects.
To properly set the locale charset make sure the LC_* environment variables are set. Normally the distribution setup tools take care of this.
Running K3b as root user
It is not recommended to run K3b under the root user account. This introduces unnecessary security risks.
Run K3b from a proper user account and setup the device and external tool permissions appropriately.
The latter can be done via "Modify Permissions...".
No problems found in system configuration.

For that, use the settings in the Regional Formats tab. The order of the values displayed here decides which translations to use for your desktop. If translations for the first language are not available, the next one in this list will be tried. The last entry of this list is always "English". Every entry below "English" will be ignored.

Unable to complete the requested search
Where to position newly open tabs in browser windows.
If set to "after-current-tab", then new tabs are inserted after the current tab. If set to "end", then new tabs are appended to the end of the tab list.
Always use the location entry, instead of the pathbar
If set to true, then Nautilus browser windows will always use a textual input entry for the location toolbar, instead of the pathbar.
Whether to ask for confirmation when deleting files, or emptying Trash
If set to true, then Nautilus will ask for confirmation when you attempt to delete files, or empty the Trash.
Whether to enable immediate deletion
If set to true, then Nautilus will have a feature allowing you to delete a file immediately and in-place, instead of moving it to the trash. This feature can be dangerous, so use caution.
When to show number of items in a folder
Speed tradeoff for when to show the number of items in a folder. If set to "always" then always show item counts, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show counts for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to compute item counts.
Type of click used to launch/open files
Possible values are "single" to launch files on a single click, or "double" to launch them on a double click.
What to do with executable text files when activated
What to do with executable text files when they are activated (single or double clicked). Possible values are "launch" to launch them as programs, "ask" to ask what to do via a dialog, and "display" to display them as text files.
Show the package installer for unknown mime types
Whether to show the user a package installer dialog in case an unknown mime type is opened, in order to search for an application to handle it.
Use extra mouse button events in Nautilus' browser window
For users with mice that have "Forward" and "Back" buttons, this key will determine if any action is taken inside of Nautilus when either is pressed.
Mouse button to activate the "Forward" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Forward" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
Mouse button to activate the "Back" command in browser window
For users with mice that have buttons for "Forward" and "Back", this key will set which button activates the "Back" command in a browser window. Possible values range between 6 and 14.
When to show thumbnails of files
Speed tradeoff for when to show a file as a thumbnail. If set to "always" then always thumbnail, even if the folder is on a remote server. If set to "local-only" then only show thumbnails for local file systems. If set to "never" then never bother to thumbnail files, just use a generic icon. Despite what the name may suggest, this applies to any previewable file type.
Maximum image size for thumbnailing
Images over this size (in bytes) won't be thumbnailed. The purpose of this setting is to avoid thumbnailing large images that may take a long time to load or use lots of memory.
Show folders first in windows
If set to true, then Nautilus shows folders prior to showing files in the icon and list views.
Default sort order
The default sort-order for items in the icon view. Possible values are "name", "size", "type" and "mtime".
Reverse sort order in new windows
If true, files in new windows will be sorted in reverse order. ie, if sorted by name, then instead of sorting the files from "a" to "z", they will be sorted from "z" to "a"; if sorted by size, instead of being incrementally they will be sorted decrementally.
Default folder viewer
When a folder is visited this viewer is used unless you have selected another view for that particular folder. Possible values are "list-view", and "icon-view".
Whether to show hidden files
This key is deprecated and ignored. The "show-hidden" key from "org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser" is now used instead.
Bulk rename utility
If set, Nautilus will append URIs of selected files and treat the result as a command line for bulk renaming. Bulk rename applications can register themselves in this key by setting the key to a space-separated string of their executable name and any command line options. If the executable name is not set to a full path, it will be searched for in the search path.
Enable interactive (type-ahead) search
If set to true, enables interactive search, similar to Nautilus 3.4.
List of possible captions on icons
A list of captions below an icon in the icon view and the desktop. The actual number of captions shown depends on the zoom level. Some possible values are: "size", "type", "date_modified", "owner", "group", "permissions", and "mime_type".
Default icon zoom level
Default zoom level used by the icon view.
Default Thumbnail Icon Size
The default size of an icon for a thumbnail in the icon view.
Text Ellipsis Limit
A string specifying how parts of overlong file names should be replaced by ellipses, depending on the zoom level. Each of the list entries is of the form "Zoom Level:Integer". For each specified zoom level, if the given integer is larger than 0, the file name will not exceed the given number of lines. If the integer is 0 or smaller, no limit is imposed on the specified zoom level. A default entry of the form "Integer" without any specified zoom level is also allowed. It defines the maximum number of lines for all other zoom levels. Examples: 0 - always display overlong file names; 3 - shorten file names if they exceed three lines; smallest:5,smaller:4,0 - shorten file names if they exceed five lines for zoom level "smallest". Shorten file names if they exceed four lines for zoom level "smaller". Do not shorten file names for other zoom levels. Available zoom levels: smallest (33%), smaller (50%), small (66%), standard (100%), large (150%), larger (200%), largest (400%)

Onboard on-screen keyboard
Onboard is configured to appear with the dialog to unlock the screen; for example to dismiss the password-protected screensaver. However the system is not configured anymore to use Onboard to unlock the screen. A possible reason can be that another application configured the system to use something else. Would you like to reconfigure the system to show Onboard when unlocking the screen?

Failed to add the CD
There was a error adding the CD, the upgrade will abort. Please report this as a bug if this is a valid Ubuntu CD. The error message was: '%s'
The server may be overloaded
Broken packages
Your system contains broken packages that couldn't be fixed with this software. Please fix them first using synaptic or apt-get before proceeding.
An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade. This can be caused by: * Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu * Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu * Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu
This is most likely a transient problem, please try again later.
If none of this applies, then please report this bug using the command 'ubuntu-bug ubuntu-release-upgrader-core' in a terminal.
Could not calculate the upgrade
Error authenticating some packages
It was not possible to authenticate some packages. This may be a transient network problem. You may want to try again later. See below for a list of unauthenticated packages.
The package '%s' is marked for removal but it is in the removal blacklist.
The essential package '%s' is marked for removal.
Trying to install blacklisted version '%s'
Can't install '%s'
It was impossible to install a required package. Please report this as a bug using 'ubuntu-bug ubuntu-release-upgrader-core' in a terminal.
Can't guess meta-package
Your system does not contain a %s or %s package and it was not possible to detect which version of Ubuntu you are running. Please install one of the packages above first using synaptic or apt-get before proceeding.
Reading cache
Unable to get exclusive lock
This usually means that another package management application (like apt-get or aptitude) already running. Please close that application first.
Upgrading over remote connection not supported
You are running the upgrade over a remote ssh connection with a frontend that does not support this. Please try a text mode upgrade with 'do-release-upgrade'. The upgrade will abort now. Please try without ssh.
Continue running under SSH?
This session appears to be running under ssh. It is not recommended to perform a upgrade over ssh currently because in case of failure it is harder to recover. If you continue, an additional ssh daemon will be started at port '%s'. Do you want to continue?
Starting additional sshd
To make recovery in case of failure easier, an additional sshd will be started on port '%s'. If anything goes wrong with the running ssh you can still connect to the additional one.
If you run a firewall, you may need to temporarily open this port. As this is potentially dangerous it's not done automatically. You can open the port with e.g.: '%s'
Can not upgrade
An upgrade from '%s' to '%s' is not supported with this tool.
Sandbox setup failed
It was not possible to create the sandbox environment.
Sandbox mode
This upgrade is running in sandbox (test) mode. All changes are written to '%s' and will be lost on the next reboot. *No* changes written to a system directory from now until the next reboot are permanent.
Your python install is corrupted. Please fix the '/usr/bin/python' symlink.
Package 'debsig-verify' is installed
The upgrade can not continue with that package installed. Please remove it with synaptic or 'apt-get remove debsig-verify' first and run the upgrade again.
Can not write to '%s'
Its not possible to write to the system directory '%s' on your system. The upgrade can not continue. Please make sure that the system directory is writable.
Include latest updates from the Internet?
The upgrade system can use the internet to automatically download the latest updates and install them during the upgrade. If you have a network connection this is highly recommended. The upgrade will take longer, but when it is complete, your system will be fully up to date. You can choose not to do this, but you should install the latest updates soon after upgrading. If you answer 'no' here, the network is not used at all.
Not for humans during development stage of release %s

No valid mirror found
While scanning your repository information no mirror entry for the upgrade was found. This can happen if you run an internal mirror or if the mirror information is out of date. Do you want to rewrite your 'sources.list' file anyway? If you choose 'Yes' here it will update all '%s' to '%s' entries. If you select 'No' the upgrade will cancel.
Generate default sources?
After scanning your 'sources.list' no valid entry for '%s' was found. Should default entries for '%s' be added? If you select 'No', the upgrade will cancel.
Repository information invalid
Upgrading the repository information resulted in a invalid file so a bug reporting process is being started.
Upgrading the repository information resulted in a invalid file. To report a bug install apport and then execute 'apport-bug ubuntu-release-upgrader'.
Third party sources disabled
Some third party entries in your sources.list were disabled. You can re-enable them after the upgrade with the 'software-properties' tool or your package manager.
Error during update
A problem occurred during the update. This is usually some sort of network problem, please check your network connection and retry.
Not enough free disk space
The upgrade has aborted. The upgrade needs a total of %s free space on disk '%s'. Please free at least an additional %s of disk space on '%s'. Empty your trash and remove temporary packages of former installations using 'sudo apt-get clean'.

Media Change
Your graphics hardware may not be fully supported in Ubuntu 14.04.
Running the 'unity' desktop environment is not fully supported by your graphics hardware. You will maybe end up in a very slow environment after the upgrade. Our advice is to keep the LTS version for now. For more information see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/UpdateManagerWarningForUnity3D Do you still want to continue with the upgrade?
Your graphics hardware may not be fully supported in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
The support in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for your Intel graphics hardware is limited and you may encounter problems after the upgrade. For more information see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/UpdateManagerWarningForI8xx Do you want to continue with the upgrade?
Upgrading may reduce desktop effects, and performance in games and other graphically intensive programs.
This computer is currently using the AMD 'fglrx' graphics driver. No version of this driver is available that works with your hardware in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. Do you want to continue?
No i686 CPU
Your system uses an i586 CPU or a CPU that does not have the 'cmov' extension. All packages were built with optimizations requiring i686 as the minimal architecture. It is not possible to upgrade your system to a new Ubuntu release with this hardware.
No ARMv6 CPU
Your system uses an ARM CPU that is older than the ARMv6 architecture. All packages in karmic were built with optimizations requiring ARMv6 as the minimal architecture. It is not possible to upgrade your system to a new Ubuntu release with this hardware.
No init available
Your system appears to be a virtualised environment without an init daemon, e.g. Linux-VServer. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS cannot function within this type of environment, requiring an update to your virtual machine configuration first. Are you sure you want to continue?
PAE not enabled
Your system uses a CPU that does not have PAE enabled. Ubuntu only supports non-PAE systems up to Ubuntu 12.04. To upgrade to a later version of Ubuntu, you must enable PAE (if this is possible) see: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE

Workarounds
Disable bootloader _graphics
The grub bootloader has a graphics mode using the VESA framebuffer driver which can sometimes interfere with later loading of the proper video driver. Checking this forces grub to use text mode only.
Disable _VESA framebuffer driver
vesafb is loaded early during boot so the boot logo can display, but can cause issues when switching to a real graphics driver. Checking this prevents vesafb from loading so these issues do not occur.
Disable _PAT memory
This pagetable extension can interfere with the memory management of proprietary drivers under certain situations and cause lagging or failures to allocate video memory, so turning it off can prevent those problems.
